        shortDescription: 'Each side presents their initial position',
        fullExplanation:
          "The opening statement establishes each debater's core thesis and primary arguments. This is the foundation upon which all subsequent arguments will build. Debaters should clearly state their position and outline their main points.",

        shortDescription: "Directly address and counter opponent's arguments",
        fullExplanation:
          "Rebuttals focus on dismantling the opponent's arguments. Debaters should identify weaknesses in logic, challenge evidence, and explain why their position remains stronger. No new arguments should be introduced.",

        fullExplanation:
          "Ad hominem attacks are strictly prohibited. Debaters must focus on the merits of arguments rather than attacking their opponent's character, intelligence, or motives. The moderator will issue warnings for violations.",
